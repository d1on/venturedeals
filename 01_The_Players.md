Disclaimer: We're not lawyers, and this is not legal advice&mdash;it's a book outline.

(01) The Players
----------------

The Entrepreneur

* As a founder, don't rely 100% on your lawyer to handle financing; there are some negotiation issues only you can resolve. Moreover, spend time helping your future investors build positive relationships with your lawyer since these relationships reflect upon you.

* Relationships amongst co-founders change, and savvy investors often include deal terms to protect co-founders from one another should things sour.

The Venture Capitalist

* Become familiar with the hierarchies of VC firms. Often, the most senior folks are called managing directors (MDs) or general partners (GPs). Then, in order of decreasing seniority, come: principals or directors, associates, and analysts. 

* Firms sometimes have a other specialized roles, such as venture or operating partners, or entrepreneurs in residence (EIRs).

* Figure out who at the firms you're talking to has real decision-making power. While you should of course treat everyone&mdash;including your primary contact&mdash;with respect, try to cultivate a relationship with an MD or GP.

The Angel Investor

* Angels are usually involved in earlier stages of funding, especially seed rounds. They're typically high-net-worth folks (qualifying them for accredited investor status with the SEC) who are investing their own money.

* Some very active angels ("super angels") invest capital from their friends or other firms as well. At this point they're not unlike VCs.

* If you're taking money from friends and family, try setting up an LP through which they can invest. It makes "chasing down" signatures (one versus many) much easier. Also, make sure these folks fully understand what they're buying into.

The Syndicate

* A syndicate is a group of investors. Typically a syndicate will have a lead investor who speaks for the group. Regardless of your relationship with the lead investor, make sure to communicate with the others as well.

* It's helpful to have the other investors agree that the lead investor can speak for them.

The Lawyer

* An experienced lawyer can be helpful just as much as a bad lawyer can be hurtful. A good lawyer will help founders focus on what matters, since he or she already knows how to handle other distracting but necessary bits.

* As of 2011, early stage financings usually cost between $5k and $15k, and later deals cost between $25k and $40k.

* Even top-tier law firms can be persuaded to be paid from deal proceeds, and almost all firms can work with fees capped in advance.

The Mentor

* Advisers typically ask for compensation up front. Mentors, on the other hand, enjoy helping entrepreneurs because they themselves were once mentees. While it's not uncommon to end up compensating them via long-term options, that's not their primary motivation.
