(02) How to Raise Money
-----------------------

Do or Do Not; There Is No Try

* Be confident about raising money. Don't frame it as "testing the waters" or even "trying to get funded," since those things seem tentative.

Determine How Much You Are Raising

* Figure out ahead of time how much money you want to raise, since the number will affect which types of investors you talk to.

* Don't worry about creating big financial models&mdash;focus on raising enough money to get to your next milestone (e.g., getting a certain number or users). This amount will vary depending on your industry (e.g., biotech is costlier than consumer web). Don't advertise this goal too publicly.

* Raising too much money will make you seem farther from your actual goal than necessary. Raise just what you need plus a small cushion.

* Pick a specific amount of money to raise, not a range. It's less confusing, and you can always raise more if there's interest.

Fund-Raising Materials

* It's still typical to create an executive (one- to three-page) summary as well as a PowerPoint deck. Make sure they're high quality, but focus on content rather than flourish, and know that you can e-mail them rather than deliver hard copies. Of course, a working prototype or demo is even better.

* Make your executive summary punchy. Include details about the idea, product, team, and explain the problem you're going to solve. Show that you can write precisely and that you've thought critically about your business. This is often a VC's first impression of your company.

* Your PowerPoint deck should have the same content as your summary, but communicate it visually. Tailor the length and style to your audience. You'd present differently in three minutes to a local group than you would during an accelerator demo day.

* While business plans are great thinking exercises, they're largely no longer necessary. Know how you'll respond if you're asked for one, however.

* Predicting startup finances is notoriously difficult. While you can't predict your revenue, you can control your monthly burn rate to some extent.

* The demo, if you have one, should be a central part of your pitch. Even if it's rough, it's a chance to tell your company's story through an experience that shows (not tells) what you're going to build. It's a way of making your vision concrete.

Due Diligence Materials

* The farther along you are in financing, the more documents you'll be expected to furnish. Organize these beforehand so you're ready to present them. And don't try to cover up any bad details. Good VCs will appreciate your honesty and, if they're interested, work with you to address them.

Finding the Right VC

* Ask your friends and other entrepreneurs to suggest VCs. If you don't have a large network, however, you can spend time researching VCs online. Think about who would be good matches based on their interests and investment strategies.

Finding a Lead VC

* It's easy to recognize an interested VC who wants to lead a round, as well as a VC who's simply not interested. It's harder to identify and engage the "maybe" and "slow no" VCs. The former can be a useful participant as a deal progresses, while the latter is likely a write-off.

How VCs Decide to Invest

* VCs will begin asking for documents (presentations, projections, team bios, etc.) as their interest increases. Founders should do their own due diligence by asking for introductions to folks the VCs have funded previously. Talking to those who ran into problems can be particularly enlightening.

* Be careful about VCs who express interest and then become quiet without ever explicitly saying no. After a point you should quit engaging them.

Closing the Deal

* Think of closing as two steps: signing the term sheet, and signing the definitive documents and receiving cash. Once a term sheet is signed, it's unlikely the deal will fall through, assuming you represented your company honestly.

* While drafting and signing the definitive agreements is largely your lawyer's turf, you should feel comfortable checking in to make sure things are going smoothly. There could be a debate going on about an issue that neither you nor the VC care about, for example.
